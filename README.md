# Rhino.Inside.TopSolid is based on McNeel's Rhino.insideÂ©. It allows Rhino and Grasshopper to run inside TopSolid.
It consists of a TopSolid AddIn, using Top'ADS API and a grasshopper plugin.
The plugin can be used to convert Geometry both ways, automate native TopSolid Operations, Create Native TopSolid Elements, manage TopSolid PDM and more.
Please note that the development is still ongoing and the current version is not yet a stable one!!
